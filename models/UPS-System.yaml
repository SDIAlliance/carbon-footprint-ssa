title: UPS System
type: object
description: |-
  A UPS system, most often a battery system, supplies a facility with uninterruptable power supply in case the grid power feeds have failed. They often act as a buffer before the backup generators can take over, or in some cases are the sole backup power system.

  Using the battery_chemistry, manufacturer and model type we determine the pollution and embodied carbon automaticaly.
